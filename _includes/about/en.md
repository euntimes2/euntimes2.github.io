# Hi — I’m **Sang-Hyun Park**

I’m an undergraduate student in **Computer Science & Engineering at Seoul National University**,  
deeply interested in how **AI, 3D vision, and robotics** can move beyond theory  
and become systems that genuinely interact with — and change — the real world.

I originally started university as a **Nuclear Engineering major**.  
But somewhere between endless equations and simulations, I realized:

> I didn’t just want to analyze systems —  
> I wanted to **build** them.

So I transferred to Computer Science, and since then, most of my days have been filled with coding, debugging, reading papers, breaking things, and slowly learning how intelligent systems really work.

## 🌌 What I’m Most Curious About

I see myself somewhere between:

- a **systems-minded engineer**, who cares about correctness, efficiency, and design; and  
- a **curious researcher**, fascinated by how machines learn and perceive the world.

Right now, I’m especially interested in:

- **3D Computer Vision** — SfM, pose estimation, point clouds, Gaussian Splatting, NeRF  
- **Representation & learning** — how models encode geometry, motion, and uncertainty  
- **Robotics** — perception-driven behavior and real-world constraints  
- **Tools & systems** — building things that scale for real users, not just demos

I don’t only want models that *work*.  
I want to understand **why they fail**, and what better design looks like.

## 🛠️ Things I’ve Built, Debugged, or Broken (and Learned From)

- Implemented core components of a **Structure-from-Motion pipeline**  
  (pose estimation, bundle adjustment, reprojection error debugging).
- Built SVM-based classifiers, tuned kernels, and dug into optimization behavior.
- Implemented **SIFT matching + RANSAC-based homography** from scratch.
- Worked with motion datasets and experimented with **flow-matching motion synthesis**.
- Created automation & visualization scripts used in real workflows.
- Designed backend services using **FastAPI, SQL, and cloud environments**,  
  focusing on correctness, clarity, and maintainability.

Most of my projects start as messy prototypes —  
and gradually evolve into structured, testable systems.

And honestly, I’ve learned as much from **bugs** as from successes.

## 🎓 Academic Background

**B.S., Computer Science & Engineering (in progress)**  
Seoul National University  

Previously: **Nuclear Engineering major** —  
which still shapes how I think about rigor, risk, and real-world constraints.

I like work that lives at the intersection of:

> **theory → implementation → impact.**

## 🚀 Why I Care About This Work

I’m not only interested in building “cool AI.”

I want to work on systems that:

- help people understand complex worlds more clearly,  
- connect digital intelligence with physical environments,  
- and encourage thoughtful, responsible technological use.

And I know I’m still early i
